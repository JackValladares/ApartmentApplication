Login Page Prototype:

The page consists of several major components.
The first of these is loginButton, which calls the
script openLoginPage(). openLoginPage() toggles the
visibility of the loginInterface div, which
includes the login form. 

The login form stores data to be implemented 
and tested alongside database iteration scripts. 
The login form has three inputs - a "username" 
input, a "password" input, and a "remember"
input, which store a username String, a password String, and
"Remember Me" Boolean respectively.

The rest of the page uses a simple css stylesheet
to give it a colorful header with a title and an
image banner running across the middle, which may
be updated to cycle/scroll through images of
housing.
