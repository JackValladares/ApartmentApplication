The Github Repository containing our Software Engineering Project

This project was done using a software stack of HTML/CSS/PHP/MySQL. We used the Agile methodology and held daily scrum meetings throughout 2-week sprints. The graphics are placeholders and the website is connected to a sample database, as the goal of this project was to be a web development learning experience rather than a functional business website.
